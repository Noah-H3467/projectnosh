    <h1>Welcome to Project Nosh Education!</h1>
    <p>If you see this, then you should know that this new website has the goal of helping you academically by 1) linking resources 2) providing study sugggestions and 3) eventually have study resources that are elsewhere 1) not free/affordable or 2) low quality. Because this is such a new website, please understand the lack of content.</p>

    <h2>If you are in middle or high school and have just decided to take academics seriously, here are a few tips for upping your education:</h2>
    <h3>Ask Questions and Communicate</h3>
    <p>Whenever you are confused or are curious on an assignment for example, ask your teacher about it. If you are in virtual class, unmute yourself or zoom chat with them. If you aren't in class, email them or remember to ask them next class. They want you to know what you are doing! (At least most of them do, anyways)</p>
    <h3>Study Consistently</h3>
    <p>Spaced studying helps you do better on tests. Be sure to know what you know and what you will be tested on, and what to study. I recommend blocking out some time across 5 days per week to study what you need to. Retrieval practice where you test yourself is important, especially where memorization is critical. This ties in with the next tip . . .</p>
    <h3>Be prepared</h3>
    <p>Preparation is more reliable than luck. Prepare for your classes and tests by being ready to learn. Stay hydrated. Have your supplies out and be on the websites (like Google Drive, Schoology) that you will need in school.</p>
    <h3>Manage your assignments</h3>
    <p>A really good way to manage your assignments is to write them down in your agenda. Write them down when you get them and check them off when you complete them.</p>
    <h3>Check your grades</h3>
    <p>Remember to see how you are doing in school! Your grades may help you understand what you have to put more time on, for example, to study. If you got a bad test score and want to do better (and can't access the test, because it is a Google Form for example) let that teacher know, and ask for them to explain what you did wrong. If you think you got a wrong answer correct, let the teacher know, in a polite and respectful way. If you want to ask them about a test that you did, better do it soon after while it is still fresh on their minds. However, don't stress yourself out by checking your online grades every hour. Just once or twice a day is enough.</p>
    <h3>Don't procrastinate</h3>
    <p>Because tomorrow is always a day away. But the due date isn't! Get your assignments done while you have time! Cramming sucks! So does pulling semi-nighters to finish a big project!</p>
    <h3>Prioritize your assignments!</h3>
    <p>"Due first, do first!" However, on long term assignments, remember to be consistently working at them. Same for studying.</p>
    <h3>Take good notes</h3>
    <p>It is always a good idea to take notes - for later review and studying. One format is the outline format. In mathematics and the sciences, I find that drawing pictures helps me understand some concepts.</p>
    <h3>Show and Earn Respect</h3>
    <p>A student on a teacher's "good side" is much more likely to be forgiven when they make a mistake (say they handed in an assignment late). Show respect towards the class, teacher, and subject and show the teacher that you care about the class. This way you can earn a teacher's respect and even your peers'.</p>
